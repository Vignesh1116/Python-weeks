# Write a program to accept the two positive integers start and stop where 0< start<stop<=100 print all

# numbers from start to stop both inclusive with following constraints.

# If the number is divisible by 3 print Divisible by 3 at the place of number.

# If the number is divisible by 5 print Divisible by 5 at the place of number.

# If the number is divisible by 10 print Divisible by 10 at the place of number.

# If the number is divisible by any of two from 3 ,5 and 10 , print nothing, just skip.

# If the number is divisible by all ( 3 , 5 and 10) , stop printing the number.

# If the number is not divisible by any of ( 3 , 5 and 10) , just print the number as it is.
